#### Sign-in interface

The deployed SmartStudy landing page provides a sign-in dialog for returning users. The form collects an email address and password and submits them through the Cognito authentication workflow.

#### Registration interface

New users can create a SmartStudy account with a name, email address, and password. The interface communicates the minimum password length before registration is submitted.

The presence of both interfaces, together with the deployed Cognito User Pools and Pre Sign-up Lambda functions, verifies the authentication flow from the frontend to the AWS identity service.
